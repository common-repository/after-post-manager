== Description ==

A powerful plugin to add text, signature or a form at the end of each post. We promise it will never take more than few minutes.

We know how it feels when we need or have to write a line or paragraph in each post every time we write a new post. And so to ease this, we've come up with this plugin. So you don't have to write a single line or paragraph each time you write a new post.

You'll find the options page of the After Post Manager in A-P Manager Menu. Go there and write a text or build a form, that's totally up to you.

At last, if you like our this plugin then show us your love with rating us 5 stars.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why we allowed editor? =

To let you build perfect forms according to your needs with less codes.

If you're facing any problem try deactivating all plugins other than this one and then switch your theme to TwentyFourteen. If things work, then the issue is with a 3rd party theme or a plugin.
